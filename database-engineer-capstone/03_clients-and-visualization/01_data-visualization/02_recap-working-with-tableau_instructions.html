 <p variant="body1">
  Data analytics is a complex process. You need to analyze large amounts of data to find answers to your questions. But this task is beyond the capabilities of traditional database management systems. That’s why data analysis is performed using data analytics tools. These tools make it possible for users to view and understand large amounts of data using powerful artificial intelligence.

  In this reading you’ll recap the basics of using Tableau to perform visualized data analytics.

  <strong>
   Getting Started with Tableau
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Tableau is used to analyze data and provide answers to different questions about business performance. However, before you can start analyzing data you need to connect Tableau to your data sources.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  To establish a live connection, you need to open Tableau on the connection page and carry out the following steps:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Under the Connect tab on the left-hand side, select the required data source (for example: “Microsoft Excel”).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    This opens a dialog box that you can use to navigate to the Excel file on your machine.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Once you open the file, the Excel file name appears on the left-hand side of the screen. The data from the Excel file is displayed in the data pane.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p variant="body1">
  After you import the data you need, you can start preparing it for analysis. This process involves fixing errors in the data and shaping it so that it’s easier to understand and analyze.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  To learn more about connecting to a data source, you can review the item

   Data Visualization
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Database analysis isn’t just about extracting and analyzing the information you need from the database. How you present your data is also just as important. Good data visualization helps decision makers to interpret the data and make the right choices around it.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  There are many different factors to consider when deciding what type of visual data to represent, summarized as follows:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Identify your target audience.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Specify what information your visualization includes.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Consider how much time you want your audience to spend examining each visualized chart.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Determine the level of accuracy your audience is looking for.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Once you’ve done this, it’s time to decide on your data visualization charts. Along this line, Tableau allows you to develop several visualized charts such as Bubble chart, Pie chart, Bar chart, Line chart, and Map chart.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Each chart has a different purpose. And each chart can be used to solve a different type of problem or communicate a different kind of message. For example, you can use a line chart to show trends, or maps to depict location-based data.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  What’s most important is to select a chart that tells your audience the story of your data in the most appropriate way.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">

  <strong>
   Data Filtering in Tableau
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  You can filter data in either the source page or the worksheet.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  However, filtering data directly in the data source limits your data analysis in all worksheets to the filtered criteria only.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  To filter data in the source, you need to select the Add option under “Filters” in Tableau source page. This opens a dialog box that lists all fields in the data source. You select then the data fields and criteria you want to apply to your data filtering.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  To filter data in a worksheet, you need to open the sheet tab at the bottom of the data source page. Then, in the worksheet, the columns from your data source are displayed as fields on the left side of the data pane. The data pane contains a variety of fields. The fields above the gray line are dimension fields. The fields below the grey line are measure fields. You can then drag the required fields into the Filter box in the Card area, where you can apply different types of data filtering.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  To learn more about data filtering in Tableau, you can review the
