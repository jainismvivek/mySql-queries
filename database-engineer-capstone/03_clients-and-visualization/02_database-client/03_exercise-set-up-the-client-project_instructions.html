   Overview
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  At this point you are familiar with all the tools required for creating a booking system for Little Lemon. You have refreshed your knowledge on Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Connector/python and version control. Now you are ready for this exercise, which is to create your working environment.

  <strong>
   Scenario
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Little Lemon needs you to help them to build a Booking System so that their guests can book tables with the restaurant. Use your knowledge of database clients to help Little Lemon complete this task.

 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   Prerequisites
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  To complete this task, you need to create a folder and then open a command prompt at that location. Next, to start writing code to create the booking system, you first need to ensure that you have Python installed, a working IDE and configured a driver that you can use to interact with your database.

   Task Instructions
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Complete the following tasks to set up the client project.

  <strong>
   Task 1
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Your first task is to navigate to your terminal and ensure that Python is installed and available on the command path. To complete this task, type the following syntax:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">python --version</pre>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  This should display the version number of the python installed. Your OS should be running Python version 3. If faced with an earlier version of Python, or a
  <var>
   command not found
  </var>
  <em>
  </em>
  message, navigate to
  <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" title="">
   https://www.python.org/downloads/
  </a>
  for instructions on how to configure and install an appropriate version for your operating system.

  <strong>
   Task 2
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Having established that an up-to date version of python is installed on your machine you will need to install Jupyter. You can install Jupyter using the following code:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">python -m pip install jupyter</pre>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Once Jupyter is installed, you can open a notebook by typing the following command in the terminal:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">jupyter notebook </pre>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Once you’ve opened Jupyter, you then need to create a new notebook for writing your code by clicking new and then selecting ipykernel. This action creates a new notebook from which you can compile code.
 </p>

 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   Task 3
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Your third and final task is to establish a connection between Python and your database using the following steps:
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  <strong>
   Step One:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Ensure that mysql-connector is installed by running the command:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">!pip install mysql-connector-python</pre>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  <strong>
   Step Two:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Import the connector under the alias connector:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">import mysql.connector as connector</pre>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  <strong>
   Step Three:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Verify that a connection can be made with your database by calling the connection method from the connector class:
 </p>
 <pre language="python">connection = connector.connect(user = "your_user_name", password = "your_password_for_database")</pre>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">

   Conclusion
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  You now have configured your working environment so that you can use it to write the code for Little Lemon’s booking system.
