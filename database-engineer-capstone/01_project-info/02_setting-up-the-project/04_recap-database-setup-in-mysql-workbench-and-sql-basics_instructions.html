   Installing MySQL Workbench
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  MySQL Workbench is open source and cross platform system available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Installing MySQL Workbench with MySQL server is a straightforward process. MySQL Workbench downloads are available at the MySQL website:
  <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/" title="">
   https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/
  </a>
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  For more details about the installation instructions, you can review the Installing MySQL Workbench item in the Advanced Data Modeling course.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Oracle provides detailed instructions about the MySQL Workbench installation process in the following link:

  <strong>
   SQL Basics
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard query language for accessing and manipulating relational databases. SQL provides four categories of commands to create, manipulate and manage data in a database known as DDL, DML, DCL and TCL.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Data Definition Language (DDL) commands are used to define and modify tables in a database such as Create, Drop, Alter and Truncate commands.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands are used to query, delete and update data in the database such as select, insert, update and delete commands.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Data Control Language (DCL) commands are used to control the roles and privileges of users of a database system such as Grant and Revoke commands.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Transaction Control Language (TCL) to manage transactions in the database such as Commit and Rollback Commands.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p variant="body1">
  If you want to learn more about each category of commands and how to use them, you can review
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-databases/supplement/x4kOK/common-sql-commands" title="">

   Database setup
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  There are few issues you need to consider when setting up MySQL Workbench to create and manage your databases.
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Create a new user. This is the most secure way to connect to your MySQL database, as you can manage user roles and privileges.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Create an instance of a MySQL server. This can be done in the MySQL Workbench home screen. In the home-screen side panel, you can select MySQL Connections option to view or create instances of MySQL.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Use connections option to load, configure, group and view information about each of your MySQL connections. You can select “Users and Privileges” under the “Management” menu to view a list of current database users.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Use your MySQL connection to begin working with database schemas and SQL queries.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  In MySQL Workbench, you can create your database in different ways. For example, you can create and use your database by writing the relevant SQL statements.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Alternatively, you can create a data model in the model designer first, then transform it into a SQL schema that can be executed and implemented directly in a MySQL server without typing any SQL code.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  To learn more about this process, you can review the
  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-data-modeling/lecture/bIYwL/database-modeling-in-mysql-workbench" title="">
