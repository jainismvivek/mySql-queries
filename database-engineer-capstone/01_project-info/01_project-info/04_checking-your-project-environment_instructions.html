  <strong>
   Scenario Setup
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Little Lemon restaurant requires an update to their booking systems. You can use your knowledge of databases to help them carry out these updates. There are several aspects that need to be considered when engaging with this project including:
 </p>
 <ul bullettype="bullets">
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Maintaining consistency when updating code.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Ensuring there are sufficient structures in place to save, alter and query data.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Ensuring there is a mechanism for displaying the data in a manner that is easily interpretable.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p variant="body1">
    Checking that there is a front-end system for accessing and updating the data.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>

  <strong>
   Working Environment
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   GIT
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Writing an application never happens in a single day. It takes time and many revisions before one completes the application to an acceptable standard. To ensure consistency throughout the writing process it is beneficial to employ some form of version control software.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  In this course you have had experience with using Git, a version control system. In addition to tracking the timescale of various updates, it also enables many different programmers contribute the production at the same time. Git can be downloaded from this location
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" title="">
   https://git-scm.com/downloads
  </a>
  . For more information on its installation and use, please consult the subsequent readings.
 </p>

 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   MySQL
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  To access and store information for the Little Lemon restaurant it is necessary to create a database. There is a plethora of different database types that can be used, such as: Oracle, SQLite, PostgreSQL and MongoDB to name a few.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  In previous courses you have had experience with MySQL. MySQL is a unified visual tool for database creation and management. It comes with several additional applications that enable smooth interaction with the data. Data can be accessed using MySQL workbench,directly using the command line, through an application client such as C/Python or Java as well as using the MySQL command-line client.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  More information is provided in the subsequent lectures. You can also find, download and implementation instruction here
  <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/" title="">

  </a>
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   Python
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  There are many different programming languages that take in user input and store it in the database. MySQL connectors are a suite of drivers that enable interaction between MySQL and several languages including: .net, Node.js, Python, C++ and C.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  There are always strengths and weaknesses associated with any given task. Some people may find that they have an affinity for different programming languages depending on their own preference and experience.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  Python is a high-level general-purpose language that was built with readability in mind. It is dynamically typed and has many built-in features that simplify the process of coding with it. In addition, it is supported by Oracle through the driver mysql-connector-python for interacting with a MySQL database.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  In this course Python is the preferred method for communicating with the database and updating the data based on user input. The subsequent lectures cover the implementation and setup of python. To download Python please go to
  <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" title="">
   https://www.python.org/downloads/
  </a>
  for an installation that is appropriate to your machine.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
 </p>
 <h2 level="2" variant="h2semibold">
  <strong>
   Tableau
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Business intelligence is gained from querying existing information and identifying existing patterns in the data. Over the years, businesses have been gathering customer data and storing it in so-called data lakes. There has been a huge focus in recent times on analyzing this data and using it to make business decisions that can result in more profitable returns.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  To better analyze data, one needs to be able to extract subsets, generate meaningful statistics and identify common trends. This task is difficult to achieve when the data exists as rows and columns in a database or excel sheet. Therefore, there have been many applications developed to aid the programmer in this task. These include PowerBI, Tableau and Qlik.
 </p>
 <p variant="body1">
  In this course Tableau is showcased as a means of extracting pertinent information and displaying it for analysis. For more information pertaining to Tableau please consult
  <a href="https://www.tableau.com/" title="">
   https://www.tableau.com/
  </a>
  as well as the subsequent lectures on visualizing information through tableau.

   Conclusion
  </strong>
 </h2>
 <p variant="body1">
  Over the last number of courses, you have gained experience with several front and back-end technologies that you can use to help Little Lemon. This capstone project involves unifying some of these projects in a hands-on exercise to gain greater insights into how best to use these systems. The main technologies that youâ€™ll engage with are Git, MySQL, Tableau, and Python. More information on these technologies is provided in subsequent lectures.
